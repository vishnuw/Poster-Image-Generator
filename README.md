   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poster-design.git
   cd poster-design
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install torch pillow ipywidgets
   ```

3. Run the `poster_design.py` script:

   ```

4. Follow the prompts to input the following details:

   - **Title/Theme**: Specify the main theme or title for your poster.
   - **Color Scheme/Vibe**: Choose the color palette or overall vibe (e.g., vibrant, minimalistic).

A vibrant poster with a retro design style for a music festival. The title/theme is 'Groove Fest'. The key text elements are: 'Live Bands, Food Trucks, Dance Floor'. Add some funky graphics and neon colors!
```

## Generated Posters

The generated posters will be saved as `poster_design_1.png`, `poster_design_2.png`, etc.

Feel free to experiment with different prompts and create unique posters!
